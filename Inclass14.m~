%Work with the image stemcells_dapi.tif in this folder

% (1) Make a binary mask by thresholding as best you can
reader14=bfGetReader('stemcells_dapi.tif');
iplane=reader14.getIndex(1-1,1-1,1-1)+1;
reader14_im=bfGetPlane(reader14, iplane); 
reader14_thres=reader14_im > 300;
imshow(reader14_thres, []);

% (2) Try to separate touching objects using watershed. Use two different
% ways to define the basins. (A) With erosion of the mask (B) with a
% distance transform. Which works better in this case?

img14_erode = imerode(reader14_thres,strel('disk',img14_sqrt));
outside = ~imdilate(reader14_thres,strel('disk',1));
basin = imcomplement(bwdist(outside));
basin = imimposemin(basin,erodemask|outside);
